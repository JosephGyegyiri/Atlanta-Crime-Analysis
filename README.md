## Introduction

Crime analysis is a crucial aspect of maintaining public safety. This project seeks to leverage geospatial analysis techniques to provide a better understanding of crime occurrences in Atlanta. By visualizing the data on maps and charts, we aim to uncover meaningful patterns that could aid law enforcement agencies, policymakers, and the community in making informed decisions.

## Data

The primary dataset used in this project is the Atlanta Police Department's crime data. This dataset contains records of various types of crimes, their locations, dates, and other relevant information. The dataset covers a span of over a decade, allowing us to identify trends and patterns that have emerged over the years.

## Analysis

Our analysis involves various stages, including:

1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, transforming, and organizing the raw data into a suitable format for analysis.
2. Geospatial Visualization: Plotting crime incidents on maps to identify crime hotspots, trends, and areas of concern.
3. Temporal Analysis: Studying how crime rates vary across different time periods, such as months, days of the week, and hours of the day **Time serie**.
4. Crime Types: Exploring the distribution of different crime types to identify prevalent and emerging criminal activities.
